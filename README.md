# The 1900s

The 1900s are a block of extensions on tilde.tel for subscribers to hack on, anyone can contribute whatever they'd like, the only caveat being that it can't infringe on any other ~tel user's good time so no Happy Dude antics

* Pick whatever extension you like within the 1901-1999 block
* Add any sound files to /sounds/[extension]
* Add any scripts or additional required files to /etc/[extension]

Let's party
